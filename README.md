# AVT_Project
Repository for the devolopment of the Three-Dimensional Visualization and Animation Project.

In this project we aim to recreate the olympic sport of rowing/canoeing in a C++ and OpenGL enviorment.
The final aim is to fully model the canoe as well as a obstacle course and provide an interface to drive
the athlete to the finish line fast and safely.
